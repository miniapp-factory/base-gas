+Create a real-time Base Gas Price + Blob Fee Tracker dashboard.
+
+- Black hacker terminal style (green text on black background)
+- Big live numbers for:
+  • Legacy Gas Price in Gwei
+  • Blob Base Fee in Gwei (correct EIP-4844 formula using excessBlobGas + blobGasUsed)
+  • Current block number
+- Auto-refresh every 12 seconds
+- Use only the free public RPC https://mainnet.base.org (eth_gasPrice + eth_getBlockByNumber latest)
+- Color code legacy gas: green <0.05, yellow <0.2, red ≥0.2
+- Add "Refresh Now" button
+- CACHE ALL DATA IN BROWSER:
+  • Use localStorage to save last known gas, blob fee, block number and timestamp
+  • On load: instantly show cached values with "(cached)" label
+  • On new data: update display + save to localStorage
+  • If RPC fails or slow, keep showing cached data with age in seconds
+- Show "Last updated X seconds ago"
+- Clean minimalist design, mobile friendly
+- Vanilla JS only, no external libraries

+Modify the existing Base Gas & Blob Fee Tracker:
+
+- Completely remove the broken logo/image at top left
+- Keep black terminal style with green text
+- Fix zero display issue: show up to 8 decimals (e.g., 0.000012 Gwei) for both Legacy Gas and Blob Base Fee
+- Correctly implement EIP-4844 blob base fee using the real exponential formula with excessBlobGas
+- Turn into a historical dashboard:
+  • Store last 200 data points (legacy gas, blob fee, block, timestamp) in localStorage only
+  • Show a simple sparkline chart below the big numbers (use <canvas> or unicode ▁▂▃▅▇ sparkline)
+  • Show 1h / 6h / 24h high/low/avg below the chart
+  • On first load, show cached history instantly
+- Keep auto-refresh every 12s, "Refresh Now" button, "Last updated X sec ago"
+- Mobile friendly, vanilla JS only, no external libs
